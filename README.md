# Smart Resume Builder

Smart Resume Builder is a web application that helps users create professional resumes easily. Users can fill in their personal, educational, and experience details and download the final resume in one click.

This project is built using the MERN stack â€“ MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. Tailwind CSS is used for styling the frontend, making it visually appealing and responsive.

The backend is connected to a MongoDB database that stores the resume details submitted by users. The resume data is saved through API routes handled by Express.js.

A feature to provide AI-based suggestions using OpenAI is also implemented. However, due to quota limits on the API, the suggestions are currently disabled. The code for it is included and can be enabled when API access is available.

The resume can be previewed on the screen and downloaded in `.txt` format. This makes it convenient for users to save or print their resume.

This project was developed as part of an internship task by Divya Nakka and demonstrates both frontend and backend integration, data handling, and real-world application structure.
